# 8-Bit-Counter-with-reset
This repository implements an 8-bit synchronous counter using Verilog HDL. The counter increments on each positive clock edge, supports reset initialization, and naturally rolls over from 255 to 0. A testbench is included to verify functionality through simulation and waveform analysis.
